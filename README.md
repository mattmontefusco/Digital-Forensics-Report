This report presents the findings of the forensic examination conducted on digital evidence
provided for two related incidents. The examination was requested by Monterey PD, California,
to determine the presence of unusual content on the hard drive of a desktop computer and to
trace the computer back to its original owner. The report also includes analysis of additional
evidence seized under a search warrant. The analysis that was done was mostly done by using
the software Autopsy. We also needed to do an acquisition for evidence 2 to have it as an image
so we can use it for analysis. We did this using FTK Imager. Here is the verification, showing
that the hash values match.
